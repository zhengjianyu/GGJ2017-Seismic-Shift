In this tutorial we will show you how you can use the Value Controller to implement some of key features pretty much every RTS 
game has to have in one form or another.


DAY / NIGHT CYCLE :
Not as fancy as those Day/Night systems out there but still. You will see how you could work with Time of Day
values using the ValueController. In addition you will learn how to use some of the awesome extension methods
weve included in this package.

UPKEEP / INCOME :
A simple implementation of a Gold Reserve for your village / town / alien planet / etc.
You will learn how to keep track of your funds using this awesome class.

TIME DISPLAY :
A small part of this tutorial deals with time keeping techniques and how you can simplify your life
and automate the clocks and watches in your game.
